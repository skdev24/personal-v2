Over four years at Lastbit/Striga, I evolved from a React Native developer to VP of Engineering, building crypto wallets and banking apps that bridged the gap between Bitcoin and traditional finance. This is the story of how we grew from 1,000 beta testers to 6k+ users across Europe, eventually getting into Y Combinator's W21 batch.

## Chapter 1: The Beginning - Lastbit Wallet (2019)

When I joined Lastbit as a React Native developer, my first challenge was improving an existing Lightning-supported Bitcoin wallet. The vision was ambitious: make Bitcoin as usable as any other currency, even when merchants didn't traditionally accept it.

### What I Built

- Enhanced UI/UX of the Lightning Bitcoin wallet
- Fixed critical bugs to improve stability
- Added a nearby user payment feature using QR scanning
- Integrated Bitcoin Lightning Network for low-latency transactions

### The Challenge

Working with the Lightning Network was technically demanding but gave me deep insights into high-frequency financial transactions. I learned to collaborate effectively with backend developers to ensure seamless integration.

**Impact**: Attracted 1,000+ beta testers, validating our core concept.

## Chapter 2: Scaling Up - Lastbit Lite & Cards (2020)

After the wallet's success, I spearheaded development of two distinct applications that would define our next phase of growth.

### Lastbit Lite: Seamless Euro-Bitcoin Exchange

## Reflection

This journey taught me that the best solutions often come from deeply understanding user needs rather than just technical capabilities. We succeeded because we made complex crypto technology feel as simple as traditional banking, while maintaining the revolutionary benefits of decentralized finance.

The progression from fixing bugs in a Bitcoin wallet to architecting a comprehensive crypto banking platform shows how technical challenges, when approached with user-first thinking, can create products that genuinely improve people's financial lives.

_Building the future of finance, one app at a time._
