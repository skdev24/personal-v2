I spent my final year with Striga in Estonia, where we achieved something remarkable: becoming one of the first companies to obtain a Virtual Asset License under Estonia's new crypto regulations. During this pivotal time, I led the development of the Striga Dashboard, a comprehensive B2B platform that would connect us with hundreds of EU companies.

**For End Users:**

### Compliance Tools: Meeting European Standards

Working within Estonia's strict regulatory framework, I developed user-friendly AML (Anti-Money Laundering) compliance tools using Retool. By collaborating directly with our AML team, I created tailored solutions that:

- Improved operational efficiency
- Ensured adherence to European data management requirements
- Reduced manual oversight tasks

- **Easy integration**: Simple embedding for any platform
- **Full customization**: Deep CSS customization capabilities
- **Client flexibility**: Adaptable to various brand requirements
